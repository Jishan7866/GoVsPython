# Sum Calculation Comparison

This repository contains Python and Go implementations for a simple summation function and compares their execution times.

## Python

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `python` folder.
3. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Go

### Prerequisites
- Go installed

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `go` folder.
3. Run the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    go mod init
    go run main.go
    ```

## Results
The scripts calculate the sum of numbers up to a specified limit (`n`). The execution time and the result of the summation will be printed for both Python and Go implementations.

### Example Output
